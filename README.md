# D3.js Introduction

## Prerequisites

A understanding of the concepts of working with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and SVG. Also realizing that D3.js is a JavaScript library used to manipulate the DOM based on data.

Knowing what SVG elements, shapes and attributes are and how to manipulate them directly or with JavaScript.

## Essentials

- Repository from Github (Classroom) **d3-introduction**

## Starting point

Clean HTML and JavaScript file with some boilerplate.

## Preparation

Trainer:

- Give everyone access tot the repository via GitHub classroom
- Explain what D3.js is and some of its concepts

Participant:

- Download repository
- Read README.MD
- Study the text from the provided links below if necessary

## Learning objective

Learning to manipulate the DOM and SVG with D3 and getting a feeling with its basics.

## Description

D3.js is a JavaScript library that can be used to manipulate the DOM in a data driven way. D# enables you to &#39;bind&#39; data to the Document Object Model (DOM) and update the DOM based on changes in the data.

D3 provides and uses selections, dynamic properties, transformations, a chaining syntax and whole lot of utility functions to enable you to create fast and powerfull visualisations.

Before diving into the data driven part, you need to have a basic understanding of D3 syntax and concepts. Things like selecting and adding (multiple) elements, manipulating element attributes and adding eventlisteners.

For our introduction to D3.js, we will look at the basic concepts of selecting, adding and manipulating elements and attributes. We will recreate a number of visuals from the previous repo&#39;s using D3.js. We will write all of this in JavaScript of course.

## Result

After the assignment you will have used a couple of basic functions of D3.js and touched on some core concepts. You will understand how create and manipulate basic SVG shapes, elements and attributes using D3.js.

## Libraries

D3.js, duh ;)
